# Small Txt-File Cryptography Service

This small program starts a CLI dialog which asks the user to decide for different parameters and functions.
The user has to decide whether he want to either decrypt or encrypt and additionaly the used encryption-key.
The program will then look for the files inside the **assets-Folder** and perform the chosen actions on them.
